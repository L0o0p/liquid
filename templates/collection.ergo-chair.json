The proper seat cushion height should be set so that your feet may rest level on the ground and your thighs are bent at a 90-degree angle when you sit.<br\/><br\/>2. The proper seat cushion level should be such that your hips are resting on the innermost part of the seat cushion and that you can customize the seat cushion depth. The seat cushion can effectively support more than two-thirds of the thigh's surface area, and that the bending angle between the thigh and the calf is 90Â°.<br\/><br\/>Â 3. the proper height of the armrest must be set so that it is 90 degrees between the arm and the elbow when used. At this point, the arm hangs down naturally and feels right, with no hanging shoulders to distract from the movement. Shoulder discomfort or frozen shoulder may result from the arm being left unsupported or with insufficient funding for a long period. This can have a significant adverse impact on health.<br\/><br\/>Â 4. When used properly, the back cushion should fully connect the whole back to the cushion, enabling the back vertebrae to be relaxed to a certain degree, thus relieving back vertebrae fatigue and avoiding chest and back pain.<br\/><br\/>Â 5. The proper waist height must be set to the position of the third, fourth, and fifth lumbar vertebrae. Except for the legs and hips, the whole weight of the human body is carried by the lumbar vertebrae in a sitting posture. As a result, adjusting the waist height correctly can help avoid conditions such as tendon or fasciitis, herniated discs, spine slippage, lumbar muscle strain, degenerative spondylitis, and sciatica.<br\/><br\/>Â 6. When using the seat cushion depth adjustability, it is essential to depend on hip strength to slide the seat cushion out. At this point, the hips must transfer force to the back through a fixed back cushion. The back will be damaged if the back cushion is not secured in position. As a result of the hips' reduced ability to exert force, the seat cushion does not slide as easily as it formerly did.<br\/><br\/>Â 7. Armrest pads should be angled correctly to offer modest support for your hand and elbow joints at all times and in different positions. Wrist tunnel syndrome and elbow joint syndrome are readily caused by a lack of right hand or elbow joint support over time. Naturally, the cervical spine is involved. The connection between protection and specificity is also present.<br\/><br\/>Â 8. For proper cervical spine support, the headrest should be adjusted to fit in between the third and seventh sections of the cervical spine. This will relieve head fatigue and help avoid bone spurs or chronic spine deterioration.<br\/><br\/>Â 9. It's important to know your body weight once you've relaxed your back so you can adjust the cushion's elasticity correctly. In cases when the elasticity exceeds the weight of the back, it will be challenging to recline comfortably. On the other hand, suppose the flexibility is less than the weight of the back. In that case, a sense of inadequacy will be created, or the fast backward will cause uneasiness.<\/p>","content_page":"","open":false}},"b6d470c5-0102-42d0-bb67-230ee9dafaa9":{"type":"item","settings":{"header":"Design points of OdinLake ergonomic chair collection","text_size":"h5","content":"<p>Ergonomic furniture is becoming more popular. We can conclude from our study on the best ergonomic chairs on the market that a good ergonomic chair is worth data and other aspects.<br\/><br\/><strong>The curve design of the chairÂ <\/strong>Curve design is studied from the aspect of people's health, and the chair's form curve design is established based on the person's physiological state, fatigue measurement, and other factors. The chair's curve is mostly determined by whether the chair cushion and backrest curves fit the human physiological curve. Odinlake's back curve is completely ergonomic, allowing the waist muscles to rest and maintain excellent position.<br\/><br\/><strong>Chair size designÂ <\/strong>The human body scale and measurement data are intimately linked to the size of furniture and the spatial connection created by its placement. To understand the concepts of human body scale design, we must first understand national standard data and be adept at incorporating anthropometric data into designs in a flexible manner. We also must learn to adapt to changing situations. Suppose you don't know how to utilize the data wisely and grasp the nature of ergonomic data. In that case, you'll end up with counterproductive results if you use it mechanically.<br\/><br\/><strong>The detailed design of the chair<\/strong>Famous designers put a premium on the finer details of their work. The same is true for chairs. This is known as the \"millimeter effect.\" According to odinlake, a few millimeters of variation will provide a wide range of relaxation to the chair, from the chair's connecting parts to the chair body. The edges and corners must be carefully polished. As a result, attention to detail is crucial to the success or failure of ergonomic furniture.<br\/><br\/><strong>The aesthetic design of the chairÂ <\/strong>To accomplish the psychological relaxation of people's ergonomics, the practical and formal beauty of the chair must be integrated, focusing on the various psychological feelings brought about by the environment's differences. Our designers think that the human curve is the most attractive and that the form of the chair, which is based on that curve, is likewise a product of nature's beauty.<br\/><br\/>In general, a good ergonomic chair design must pay close attention to the form design of the chair to adapt to the features of the item, in addition to the suitable size: adapting to the scale's features; adapting to functional characteristics; adapting to changing characteristics To adapt to the material's qualities; to concentrate on the combination of form and color; to have a feeling of the times, to meet the demands of the workplace; to examine the human peculiarities of various nations; to concentrate on technology and sustainable development.<\/p>","content_page":"","open":false}}},"block_order":["template--16510510760104__3e5f9978-0523-4a72-a79d-ac58a8565ea7-item-1","template--16510510760104__3e5f9978-0523-4a72-a79d-ac58a8565ea7-item-2","b6fd4cee-4aac-4eba-941e-f97de6b0293b","b6d470c5-0102-42d0-bb67-230ee9dafaa9"],"custom_css":[".m-section__header {margin-bottom: 5px;}"],"settings":{"container":"container-narrow","color_scheme":"","image_position":"left","column_gap":100,"heading":"","heading_size":"h3","subheading":"","description":"<h4>Ergonomic Office Chair Design<\/h4>","header_alignment":"left","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":54,"animations":"inherit","custom_class":""}},"ea76567c-86b5-4c35-896f-09b942fbfa9b":{"type":"collapsible-tabs","blocks":{"1831bce4-fece-4f36-9011-a0bdc1daa240":{"type":"item","settings":{"header":"Collapsible tab heading","text_size":"h5","content":"<p>Shipping cost is based on weight.
